## Little Lemon App

This is final capstone project app for the Meta React Native developer certification on Coursera. This app is built from create-expo-app template.

### Before running the app

To install the necessary npm packages for your project, follow these steps:

Open the Terminal in Visual Studio Code. You can do this by clicking on Terminal in the top menu, then New Terminal.

In the terminal, make sure you're in the correct directory where your project is located. If not, navigate to it using the cd command. For example, if your project is in a folder named my_project on your desktop, you would type cd Desktop/my_project.
